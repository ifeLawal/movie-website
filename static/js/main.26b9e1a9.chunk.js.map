As Adam navigates the romantic relationship waters, Mike struggles connecting to his former drug-addicted son who has just returned home, and Neil develops a relationship with another woman in his sex addicts group, but a platonic friendship might be exactly what he needs.\",\n            \"moviePoster\": \"/thanksforsharing/thanksforsharingposter.jpg\",\n            \"locationInfo\": {\n                \"address\": \"Lido Bar, 2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd & West 117th Street\",\n                \"coords\": [\n                    -73.644,\n                    40.6045\n                ]\n            },\n            \"images\": [\n                \"/thanksforsharing/thanksforsharing35.jpg\",\n                \"/thanksforsharing/thanksforsharing34.jpg\",\n                \"/thanksforsharing/thanksforsharing33.jpg\",\n                \"/thanksforsharing/thanksforsharing55.jpg\",\n                \"/thanksforsharing/thanksforsharing57.jpg\"\n            ],\n            \"neighborhood\": \"New York, Harlem\",\n            \"comment\": \"\",\n            \"place_name\": \"Barnum Island, New York, United States\",\n            \"Year\": \"2012\",\n            \"Rated\": \"R\",\n            \"Released\": \"14 Sep 2013\",\n            \"Runtime\": \"112 min\",\n            \"Genre\": \"Comedy, Drama, Romance\",\n            \"Director\": \"Stuart Blumberg\",\n            \"Writer\": \"Stuart Blumberg, Matt Winston\",\n            \"Actors\": \"Mark Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, Gwyneth Paltrow, Josh Gad\",\n            \"Plot\": \"A romantic comedy that brings together three disparate characters who are learning to face a challenging and often confusing world as they struggle together against a common demon: sex addiction.\",\n            \"Language\": \"English\",\n            \"Country\": \"USA\",\n            \"Awards\": \"2 nominations.\",\n            \"Poster\": \"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MzI3ODcxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY5MTc4OQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg\",\n            \"Ratings\": [\n                {\n                    \"Source\": \"Internet Movie Database\",\n                    \"Value\": \"6.4/10\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"Source\": \"Rotten Tomatoes\",\n                    \"Value\": \"51%\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"Source\": \"Metacritic\",\n                    \"Value\": \"54/100\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"Metascore\": \"54\",\n            \"imdbRating\": \"6.4\",\n            \"imdbVotes\": \"26,183\",\n            \"imdbID\": \"tt1932718\",\n            \"Type\": \"movie\",\n            \"DVD\": \"07 Jan 2014\",\n            \"BoxOffice\": \"$752,929\",\n            \"Production\": \"Roadside Attractions\",\n            \"Website\": \"N/A\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 34,\n        \"movie\": {\n            \"title\": \"One Night Stand\",\n            \"year\": \"1997\",\n            \"summary\": \"Los Angeles commercials director Max Carlyle (Wesley Snipes) visits his friend, artist Charlie (Robert Downey Jr.), who wasdiagnosed with AIDS in New York.

So it's a good thing he planned ahead. Before he died, Gerry wrote Holly a series of letters that will guide her, not only through her grief, but in rediscovering herself. The first message arrives on Holly's 30th birthday in the form of a cake, and to her utter shock, a tape recording from Gerry, who proceeds to tell her to get out and \\\"celebrate herself\\\". In the weeks and months that follow, more letters from Gerry are delivered in surprising ways, each sending her on a new adventure and each signing off in the same way; P.S. I Love You. Holly's mother and best friends begin to worry that Gerry's letters are keeping Holly tied to the past, but in fact, each letter is pushing her further into a new future. With Gerry's words as her guide, Holly embarks on a journey of rediscovery in a story about marriage, friendship and how a love so strong can turn the finality of death into a new beginning for life.\",\n            \"moviePoster\": \"/psiloveyou/piiloveyouposter.jpg\",\n            \"locationInfo\": {\n                \"address\": \"Holly and Gerry's Apartment, 254 Broome Street and Orchard Street\",\n                \"coords\": [\n                    -73.783095,\n                    40.649816\n                ]\n            },\n            \"images\": [\n                \"/psiloveyou/psiloveyou08.jpg\",\n                \"/psiloveyou/psiloveyou07.jpg\",\n                \"/psiloveyou/psiloveyou09.jpg\",\n                \"/psiloveyou/psiloveyou10.jpg\"\n            ],\n            \"neighborhood\": \"John F.

While he is successful, Ms. Walker learns that he calls himself Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn)and he claims to be the actual Santa Claus. Despite reassurances by Kringle's doctor that he is harmless, Doris still has misgivings, especially when she has cynically trained herself, and especially her daughter, Susan, to reject all notions of belief and fantasy. And yet, people, especially Susan, begin to notice there is something special about Kris and his determination to advance the true spirit of Christmas amidst the rampant commercialism around him and succeeding in improbable ways. When a raucous conflict with the store's cruelly incompetent psychologist erupts, Kris finds himself held at Bellevue where, in despair, he deliberates fails a mental examination to ensure his commitment. All seems lost until Doris' friend, Fred Gaily, reassure Kris of his worth and agrees to represent him in the fight to secure his release. To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact Santa Claus. What ensues is a bizarre hearing in which people's beliefs are reexamined and put to the test, but even so, it's going to take a miracle for Kris to win.\",\n            \"moviePoster\": \"/miracleon34thstreet/miracleon34thstreetposter.jpg\",\n            \"locationInfo\": {\n                \"address\": \"New York County Supreme Court, 60 Centre Street, Financial\",\n                \"coords\": [\n                    -73.989347,\n                    40.693598\n                ]\n            },\n            \"images\": [\n                \"/miracleon34thstreet/miracleon34thstreet11.jpg\",\n                \"/miracleon34thstreet/miracleon34thstreet10.jpg\",\n                \"/miracleon34thstreet/miracleon34thstreet09.jpg\",\n                \"/miracleon34thstreet/miracleon34thstreet14.jpg\",\n                \"/miracleon34thstreet/miracleon34thstreet13.jpg\"\n            ],\n            \"neighborhood\": \"Downtown, Manhattan\",\n            \"comment\": \"\",\n            \"place_name\": \"Kings County Supreme Court, 360 Adams St, New York, New York 11201, United States\",\n            \"Year\": \"1947\",\n            \"Rated\": \"Not Rated\",\n            \"Released\": \"02 Oct 1947\",\n            \"Runtime\": \"96 min\",\n            \"Genre\": \"Comedy, Drama, Family\",\n            \"Director\": \"George Seaton\",\n            \"Writer\": \"George Seaton (written for the screen by), Valentine Davies (story)\",\n            \"Actors\": \"Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn, Gene Lockhart\",\n            \"Plot\": \"When a nice old man who claims to be Santa Claus is institutionalized as insane, a young lawyer decides to defend him by arguing in court that he is the real thing.\",\n            \"Language\": \"English, Dutch\",\n            \"Country\": \"USA\",\n            \"Awards\": \"Won 3 Oscars.

At the same time, she finds herself attracted to Frank, the divorced father of one of her students, as the two get to know each other via lengthy telephone conversations. For their first date he escorts her to a party at Bernice's apartment.\\nComplications arise when April discovers she is pregnant, the result of a quick and clumsy coupling with Ben on the kitchen floor just before he left her. April has longed to have a child all her life and is delighted with the news, but is confused and upset by Ben's sudden return, Frank's hasty departure, and Bernice's insistent attempts to create a bond btw them. Not helping the situation is the discovery Bernice voluntarily put her up for adoption a full year after her birth and not three days later at the urging of her parents, according to the scenario she initially presented. When April miscarries, her brother Freddy tries to counsel her, but ultimately she must rely on her deep-rooted faith to deal with the betrayals she has suffered not only at the hands of those she trusted but by the God she worships as well.\",\n            \"moviePoster\": \"/thenshefoundme/thenshefoundmeposter.jpg\",\n            \"locationInfo\": {\n                \"address\": \"East 78th Street\",\n                \"coords\": [\n                    -73.9157014,\n                    40.635625\n                ]\n            },\n            \"images\": [\n                \"/thenshefoundme/thenshefoundme08.jpg\",\n                \"/thenshefoundme/thenshefoundme07.jpg\",\n                \"/thenshefoundme/thenshefoundme06.jpg\",\n                \"/thenshefoundme/thenshefoundme01.jpg\"\n            ],\n            \"neighborhood\": \"Canarsie, Manhattan\",\n            \"comment\": \"\",\n            \"place_name\": \"East 78th Street, Brooklyn, New York 11236, United States\",\n            \"Year\": \"2007\",\n            \"Rated\": \"R\",\n            \"Released\": \"09 May 2008\",\n            \"Runtime\": \"100 min\",\n            \"Genre\": \"Comedy, Drama, Romance\",\n            \"Director\": \"Helen Hunt\",\n            \"Writer\": \"Alice Arlen (screenplay), Victor Levin (screenplay), Helen Hunt (screenplay), Elinor Lipman (novel)\",\n            \"Actors\": \"Helen Hunt, Bette Midler, Colin Firth, Matthew Broderick\",\n            \"Plot\": \"39-year-old April Epner's childish husband and school teacher colleague Benjamin/Ben leaves her, but with her biological clock ticking ever more loudly.
